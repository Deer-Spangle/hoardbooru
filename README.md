# hoardbooru
Various scripts and tools and bots for managing and administering our local szurubooru instance

## Notion upload script
The notion upload script, in `utils/notion_upload` is a script to import art from our notion board to hoardbooru. It is
very specialised to our notion board and to our hoardbooru instance. It will likely not be useful to any other people.

There is a readme inside that directory, better explaining the tooling there.

## Telegram bot
The telegram bot, in `bot/hoardbooru_bot` allows users to search for art on hoardbooru and to upload and tag new art for
it.
